            <p>You know, Tess, I've been thinking. I've been this funny perv guy since we met giving you premium clown services😂, no subscription needed 😂</p>
            <p>But real talk… I like you na najua you know that and I've tried to laugh it off, lakini wapi, it's deeper than just jokes or the physical stuff we've had together. You're someone I'd actually want to get to know more but at your pace cause I know myself with my impatience😂, and it's not on impulse I swear. So yeah… I'm putting my serious hat on jokes aside about this, just for this once. What do you say?</p>
